                <p>A repository is a collection of files (usually computer programs) that are associated. An example
                    might be the program files that make Github work. Just above the
                    first line of the file you will see an icon on the right that looks like a pencil. You can then edit
                    any other files that need changing using this process.
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the pencil to edit the file.</li>
                    <li>When you finish changing the file scroll down to "Commit changes".</li>
                    <li>There are two text boxes you can type into. Put a brief description of the chnages you made in
                        the Github box and a detailed description of the changes
                        in the lower(larger) box.

                    <p>
                        The repository you want to clone is stored on Github and you must have access to it, either
                        because you own it, someone has invited you to work on it or because
                        it is a public repository. <br><em>It is important to run the clone command from a directory
                            that is not a part of an existing repository on your local machine. If you
                            "nest" repositories, Git becomes confused and your repository will be corrupted and
                            unusable.</em> For this reason I recommend you create a directory, perhaps called
                        myRepositories, and always run the clone from that directory. <br><em>The clone command will
                            create a new subdirectory that is the name of the repository you are cloning
                            and fill that directory with the repository contents.</em> You will then need to change to
                        that directory using the "cd" command to see the contents of the repository
                        on your local computer. <br><em>Git commands are very helpful by often letting you know what
                            needs to be done to fix a problem or to offer the next step in working with
                            your files. "git status" will show you the status of your repository at any time!</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create the repository using the github.com website.</li>
                        <li>On your PC change to a high level directory where your git projects with be stored (ie. "cd"
                            - with no parameter, puts you in your home directory.</li>
                        <li>Type "git init" to setup the files Git will need to manage files on your PC.</li>
                        <li>Type "git clone git@github.com:&lt;your Github user name here&gt;&lt;your Github repository
                            name here&gt;.git" to clone this repository.
                            <br>Replace &lt;your Github user name here&gt; with your Github user name. Do not include
                            the &lt; or &gt; symbols.
                            <br>Replace &lt;your Github repository name here&gt; with the Github repository name. Do not

                            <br>The full clone command can be found on Github by clicking the "Code" button in the

                <div class='details'>
                    <p>Github provides a tool allowing you to publish your work so others can see your results, rather
                        than your repository.
                        <br>To do this follow the following steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open your repository on Github (browser)</li>
                        <li>Click on "Settings" above the code.</li>
                        <li>Click on "Pages" on the left column that is displayed under Settings.</li>
                        <li>Select "Branch: main", / (root) & click the "Save button".</li>
                    </ul>
                    It takes a few minutes for the process to publish your repository. You should see a box on the
                    "Pages" screen that tells you the URL for your publisehed repository.
                    <br>Click that link to see your work and share the link with your friends that you want to see your
                    work.
                    </p>

                    <p>It is always recommended to type "git status" when things are not working right. The output from
                        this command often gives you clues, and often the answer to fix the
                        problem you are having.
